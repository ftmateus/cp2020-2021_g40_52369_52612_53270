At the end of project, we analysed and evaluated our work division and performance and we honestly conclude that there was some imbalance of our work division, as stated below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Francisco Mateus} 50\% - Was responsible for implementing the energy relaxation and maximum location sections of the program, implementing the python and bash scripts, doing the benchmarks on the cluster, fixing some bugs and writing the report.
    \item \textbf{Dionisie Tarlev}  35\% - Was responsible for implementing the energy bombardment section, giving useful insights about the energy bombardment and relaxation sections of the program, fixing some bugs and writing the report.
    \item \textbf{Diogo Silva}  15\% - Was responsible for fixing some bugs on the maximum location section on both the original code and the paralleled one, and writing the report.
\end{itemize}
