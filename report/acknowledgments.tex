As for acknowledgements we want to thank professor João Lourenço for lecturing CP class with great materials (recommended book and slides) and having a high availability to clarify questions online. Our colleagues from the piazza platform that made questions about similar dilemmas that we came across throughout the project and finally to the great descriptive documentation available online for OpenMP that helped us brainstorm on how to build our parallel program. 
\par We specially want to thank Dionisie Tarlev 52612, who gave wonderful ideas about the optimization and parallelization of the Energy Bombardment and Relaxation phases. We also thank Group 02, more specifically Alexandre Correia 53298, for brainstorming ideas on how to parallelize some parts of the program.
