As for acknowledgements we want to thank professor João Lourenço for lecturing CP class with great materials (recommended book and slides) and having a high availability to clarify questions online. Our colleagues from the piazza platform that made questions about similar dilemmas that we came across throughout the project and finally to the great descriptive documentation available online for OpenMP that helped us brainstorm on how to build our parallel program.
